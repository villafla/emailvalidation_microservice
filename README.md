How to use:
- Make POST requests to the /validate-email endpoint.
- When a POST request is made to /validate-email, the validate_email function extracts the email address from the request data and validates it using the validate_email_function.
- Results of the validation are stored in the response_data dictionary.
- The jsonify(response_data) function is used to convert the response_data dictionary into a JSON response, and this JSON response is returned to the client making the request.
